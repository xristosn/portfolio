# Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website. I built it to display my projects and have a central place for my work.

### Built With

- **Framework:** React 19 & TypeScript
- **Bundler:** Vite
- **Routing:** React Router 7
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4
- **UI Components:** ShadCN

## About the Background

If you are interested in the background, it is made entirely with the **Canvas API** (no external animation libraries).

I used a grid system that updates using `requestAnimationFrame`. The "warping" effect is created by calculating the distance of each grid point from the center of the screen and applying a sine wave displacement.

The animation is programmed to cycle between a solid grid and a dot pattern.
